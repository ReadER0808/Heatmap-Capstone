## Optimal matching - Traminer

This code block implements the Traminer package and generates a heatmap with a dendrogram based on trace distances calculated through sequence alignment. There is one code block for execution. This code block covers the following:

1.  Library calls.

2.  Pre-processing for analysis.

3.  State sequence plot and heatmap generation.

### Library calls

The code block begins by loading necessary libraries for data manipulation and visualisation. These include `TraMiner`, `TraMinerExtras`, `RColorBrewer`, `seqhandbook`, `FactoMineR`, `cluster`, `WeightedCluster`, `pals`.

### Pre-processing for analysis

Preprocessing the data to prepare it for further analysis:

-   `dataset` copied to `trace_df`.

-   `trace_df` filtered for duplicate IDs (shouldn't happen - but have add digit truncation of `Unique_ID` issues when importing the data initially.

-   Create rownames for `trace_df` based on `Unique_ID`.

-   Drop `Unique_ID` column.

-   Assign numbers as column names from 1 to the number of columns in `trace_df`.

-   Extract a vector from `trace_df` comprising the unique tokens (`unique_tokens`) in `trace_df`.

-   Set a color palette (`my_color`) based on the length of `unique_tokens`.

### State sequence plot and heatmap generation

Generation of the state sequence and heatmap plots:

-   The TraMinerR function `seqact` prepares `trace_df` for plotting, incorporating the token color assignment from `my_color` and the plot is rendered using `seqdplot`.

-   A matrix (`indics`) is then generated showing the number of times in a state (token). This acts as an input into the inter-trace distance calculations. Alternative functions can be used for different feature measures such as duration in state or state transitions (see TraMineR documentation).

-   The matrix `indics` is then processed using PCA with no scaling and six components (these can be modified).

-   The distance (Euclidean) matrix is then calculated on the processed `indics` matrix (other distance measure can be used).

-   Hierarchical clustering is then done.

-   The heatmap, as ordered from the clustering is then plotted, with the cluster dendrogram adjacent.

dataset <- read.csv("mod_r_data.csv", header = TRUE, check.names = FALSE)

### Data preparation 

### Assign row names using first column

### Assign dataset to a new dataframe
trace_df <- dataset
trace_df <- trace_df[!duplicated(trace_df[ , c("UniqueID")]),] ### remove duplicates occurring due to read problems. Reading seems to truncate ID digits

### Assign rownames to trace_df using UniqueIDsand drop UniqueID column
rownames(trace_df) <- trace_df[,1]
trace_df <- trace_df[ , -1]

### Assign column names for plots
colnames(trace_df) <- c(paste0("", 1:(ncol(trace_df))))

# Convert the dataset to a matrix and then to a vector, and extract unique tokens
unique_tokens <- unique(as.vector(as.matrix(trace_df)))

### Assign high-contrast colors to each unique token for heatmap coloring
my_color <- structure(kelly(n=length(unique_tokens)), names = unique_tokens)


### Trace state-sequence plots and heatmaps using TraMiner ### 

### Generate state sequence plot 
seqact <- seqdef(trace_df, labels = unique_tokens, cpal = my_color)
seqtab(seqact, idx = 0) %>% nrow
seqdplot(seqact, border = NA, cex.axis = 0.5, cex.legend = 0.4)

### Create a matrix for the number of times each trace has been in a token (state)
### Forms the basis for the distance matrix
### Other functions are available in TraMiner using alternative distance measures such as 
### duration in state, state visited etc.
indics <- seqinepi(seqact)

### head(indics)

### PCA for the distance matrix, options include scaling (set to false) and number of dimensions
### (set to 6).
### Alternative methods are also availabe for the distance measure
acp_coords <- PCA(indics, scale.unit = FALSE, ncp = 6, graph = FALSE)$ind$coord
dissim <- dist(acp_coords, method = 'euclidean') %>% as.matrix

### Hierarchical clustering using Wardâ€™s method and the agnes function of the cluster package.
agnes <- as.dist(dissim) %>% agnes(method = "ward", keep.diss = FALSE)

### Cluster dendrogram
as.dendrogram(agnes) %>% plot(leaflab = "none")
seq_heatmap(seqact, agnes)

### Heatmap of traces as order by the cluster results
plot(sort(agnes$height, decreasing = TRUE)[1:50], type = "s")
wardRange <- as.clustrange(agnes, diss = dissim)
summary(wardRange, max.rank = 2)
plot(wardRange, stat = c('ASW', 'R2', 'CH'), norm = "zscore")


```
